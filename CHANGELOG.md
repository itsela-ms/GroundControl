# Changelog

All notable changes to DeepSky are documented here.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- Session dashboard view when no tabs are open
- Live session status polling — badges update every 3s based on actual pty output
- Session state now uses `isBusy` (recent output) instead of focused-session heuristic
- Graceful shutdown — busy sessions stay alive in background when closing (10-min timeout)
- Close confirmation dialog when AI sessions are still processing
- Unit test infrastructure (Vitest) with 27 tests for session-state and pty-manager
- Extracted `session-state.js` — pure function for state derivation

### Changed
- "Working" state now means AI is actively outputting (green), "Waiting" means idle terminal (yellow)
- `pty-manager` tracks `lastDataAt` per session and exposes it via `getActiveSessions()`
- `pty-manager` accepts injectable pty module for testability

### Fixed
- Notification click not focusing the target session (rAF race condition)
- Session state badges going stale between discrete UI events

## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- Session state badges — each session shows a colored state pill (Idle / Working / Waiting / Pending / ✓ Done)
- Graceful shutdown — busy sessions stay alive in the background when closing, with a 10-minute timeout
- Close confirmation dialog when AI sessions are still processing

### Changed
- Resource panel toggle button changed from ⊞ to 🔗
- Resource icons (Repo/Wiki/PR/WI) styled as auto-width pill badges to prevent text overlap

### Fixed
- Resource panel icon text ("Repo", "Wiki") overlapping with resource label names

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-17

### Changed
